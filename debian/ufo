#!/bin/sh

# This is a wrapper script to launch the real ufoai binary, suitable
# for a site-wide install on a UNIX-like OS.
#
# It assumes the game was installed in $INSTDIR, and
# $INSTDIR/base/save/ does not exist (reasonable assumption for a
# site-wide install).
#
# It creates a ~/.ufoai/ dir, suitable as a current-directory
# to launch the game in, such that ufo can write player's data.
# The user is allowed to some extent to replace the symlinks to system
# data with copies, maybe modified.

# Known limitations:
# - the script does not detect if the user has replaced the symlinks
# with invalid ones.
