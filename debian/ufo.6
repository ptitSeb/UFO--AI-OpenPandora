.SH "FILES"
All theses files are part of a pk3 file in \fI/usr/share/games/ufoai/base/\fR. You can extract them (pk3 files are just zip files)
and place them in the home directory of the user running the game. Use the path \fI~/.ufoai/<VERSION>/base/\fR to place
these files. The files that are not located in the pk3 files have a higher priority than the files that are stored in the pk3
files. So you are able to replace any file you want like this. You can also add new maps and other game content to the \fIbase/\fR
directory in your users home directory to be able to use new content in the game.
