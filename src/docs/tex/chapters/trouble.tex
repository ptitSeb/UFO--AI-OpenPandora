\section{Troubleshooting}
This section tries to address some known problems and possible workarounds. However, your first and most up-to-date reference should be the project homepage. Make sure that you also check out the FAQ\footnote{\url{http://ufoai.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ}}.

Your game console is logged to your UFO:AI userdata directory and is named \gamepath{ufoconsole.log}. It might have some useful information on what is wrong.

\subsection{Turning off sound completely}
Even if this is not an elegant way to solve problems, it at least helps to narrow things sometimes to switch off any sound. While simply turning the volume to zero still loads the drivers, the command \consolecommand{+set snd\_init 0}  disables them completely. If this solves your problem, please send in a bug report so your issue might be addressed.

\subsection{Video drivers}
If you're running Windows or Linux, you should always ensure that you have the latest vendor-specific video drivers for your card.

\subsection{Turning on developer mode}
You can set the cvar \cvar{developer} to \cvarvalue{1} or use the \consolecommand{setdeveloper} command to activate the debug output on the game console. \textbf{Warning:} There might be a lot of output that will flood your game console. Output is also stored in your \gamepath{ufoconsole.log}.

\subsection{Reset your configuration}
It might also help from time to time to reset your configuration. To do this, delete \gamepath{config.cfg} in your UFO:AI userdata directory.
