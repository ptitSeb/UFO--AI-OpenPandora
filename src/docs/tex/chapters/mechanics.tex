\subsection{Promotions}
While the actual implementation is still under heavy discussion a few comments might help to understand how it works now. Despite what one may think, the main criteria for promotions is not the missions / kills ratio but the mind skill. You simply don't want a psychopathic, thrill seeking terminator like guy as squadleader but someone who is mentally stable. Currently, only one member of your squad can be promoted at a time.  Here are a few of the rank badges.

\end{tabular}

The complete list of ranks is Rifleman (Rfn), Lance Corporal (LCpl), Corporal (Cpl), Sergeant (Sgt), Warrant Officer (WO), Senior Warrant Officer (SWO), Second Lieutenant (2Lt), Lieutenant (Lt), Captain (Capt), Major (Maj), Lieutenant Colonel (Lt Col), and Colonel (Col).
