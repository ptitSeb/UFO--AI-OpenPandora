Blender export script:

The blender script md2_export.py is released with Blender v2.42a, and will most likely also work with later versions.

If you don't have it in your blender-instalaltion you can just copy it into your "scripts" directory in your blender installation or ".blender/scripts" user directory.

The same is true for md2_import.py.
