UFO--AI-OpenPandora
===================

UFO: Alien Invasion for OpenPandora (featuring ARM support and GLES renderer)

OpenPandora
===========

This fork is aimed at OpenPandra, so get:
 * ARM compatibilty (using -DARM)
 * Some NEON optimized code (using -DNEON)
 * GLES renderer (using -DHAVE_GLES)
 * OpenPandora support of course (using -DPANDORA), for screen resolution and font size mainly.
 
For the Pandora version, I used some Hardwired modif in the Makefile (look in build/ and build/modules)
